# Exploratory Analysis for US Arrests Dataset with PCA and Clustering

The objective of this notebook is to explore the differences between various arrests in the USA using unsupervised learning methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and various clustering techniques.

This dataset is from the US Arrests Kaggle challenge [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kurohana/usarrets). A description of the data is given as: “This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.”
